import { getFirestore } from 'firebase/firestore';
import { getAuth } from 'firebase/auth';
import { getStorage } from 'firebase/storage';

const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "...",
  authDomain: "...",
  projectId: "...",
  storageBucket: "...",
  messagingSenderId: "...",
  appId: "...",
};

const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
export const db = getFirestore(app);
export const auth = getAuth(app);
export const storage = getStorage(app);
```

## Stripe Integration

Payment processing is handled through Stripe:

- Integrated in the checkout process
- Configured in `src/lib/stripe.ts`
- Uses `@stripe/react-stripe-js` for React components

## Payment Processors

The application supports multiple payment methods through the `PaymentForm` component:

### Available Payment Methods

   - Simple option for pay-on-delivery orders
   - No external integration required
   - Fully customizable messaging and instructions

### Adding or Editing Payment Methods

To modify existing payment methods or add new ones:

1. **Edit `src/components/PaymentForm.tsx`**:

   - Each method has its own form and handling logic

2. **For adding a new payment method**:
   - Add a new tab in the `TabsList` component
   - Create a new `TabsContent` section with the form and logic
   - Update the `paymentMethod` state type to include your new method
   - Implement the handling function for the new payment method

3. **For modifying an existing payment method**:
   - Locate the relevant `TabsContent` section
   - Modify the form, styling, or logic as needed
   - Update validation rules if necessary

4. **Handling success and callbacks**:
   - All payment methods use the `onSuccess` prop to notify the parent component
   - The parent component (`Checkout.tsx`) handles the order creation

### Payment API Keys

For payment processors requiring API keys:

1. **Stripe**: 
   - Update the publishable key in `src/lib/stripe.ts`
   - Keep the secret key secure on your backend

2. **PayPal**: 
   - Update the client ID in the `PayPalScriptProvider` in `PaymentForm.tsx`
   - Configure additional parameters in the same component

3. **Other Processors**:
   - Add API keys and configuration to appropriate files
   - Follow security best practices for handling keys

## Authentication

User authentication flow:
